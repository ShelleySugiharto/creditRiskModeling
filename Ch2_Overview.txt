CHAPTER 2 OVERVIEW:
The goal of modelling is to focus in on the essence of a situation.
Modelling cannot exctly replicate real life, but it can reduce the dimensionality of it,
and get to a emphasized portion of it.

The world of credit risk relies on 2 outcomes for a risk event:
- default
- survival

In market risk, there are different outcomes and considerations, making it continuous in most cases.
Credit risk is then discrete.

default-loss distribution is a default outcome vs. frequency 
*the count chart is only counting the amt of times that default scenario would happen

count charts seem to follow a normal distribution, while default-loss tends to follow a gamma distribution

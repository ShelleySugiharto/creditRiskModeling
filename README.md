# creditRiskModeling
Notes and applications of credit risk modelling from the book, "Credit-Risk Modelling" by David Jamieson Bolder and "The Handbook of Fixed Income Securities" by Frank Fabozzi.

There is a focus on Dr.Fabozzi's book, since it includes fixed income content and credit analysis content. Additionally, there are uses of modelling in fixed income scenarios specifically.

CHAPTER 1 AND GENERAL OVERVIEW:

Pricing VS. Risk Management:
Pricing follows an asset focusing on the central point in a default-loss distribution.
Pricing uses the risk-neutral measure (Q).

Risk management tends to focus on the tail in a default-loss distribution.
Risk management uses the physical measure (P).

Difference between credit-risk and market-risk?

credit-risk:
- tends to be idiosyncratic
- tends to focus on static movement
- has less historical data to make definitive conclusions

market-risk:
- tends to be systematic
- tends to focus on dynamic movement
- has abundant historical data, helping to make definitive conclusions

**However, both credit and market risk can cross-over
    - specifically, the movement in market-risk is also static in a sense
    (for analysis against different time periods)


Analyzing Credit:
- decide the type of model:
    - static/dynamic
    - structured/reduced-form
    - independent/dependent
    - instrument-based/portfolio-based
- Define relationship between credit obligor exposure and their default probabilities
- Define relationahip according to regions/sections -> 
basically, find reasonable patterns
- Create defult-loss distribution based off chosen credit risk model

Types of Credit Risk Models:
- independent: simplest, assumes default events are independent of their obligor
- mixture: assumes less default independence by randomizing default probabilities
- Threshold: looks at default events in more detail, permits default dependence,
and allows for alt distributional choices (Most popular)

common risk measures in portfolio management:
- Credit VaR
- Expected shortfall (aka, conditional VaR or tail VaR)
(both measured by confidence lvls)

**Quantiles are important because they are the VaR measures of different confidence lvls

Decomposing Risk Measures:
- using diagnostic tools to benchmark
- using different models allows for proper assessment of credit obligor status
- comparison between individual and threshold models allows for certain data confirmations
- use of mixture models usually helps more in benchmarking, finding outliers and possible
issues in creating our models
